[Game Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjskJzHCGd8)

## Opening The Game
To play, you must open client.py which is located in the client folder or the client executable which you can get by either [downloading one](https://github.com/D4isDAVID/Spaceship-Battle/releases) or building one yourself.

You also need a server. The server by default is bound to IP 0.0.0.0 with PORT 7723.

## Building a Executable
This requires PyInstaller.
* Run `python build_server.py` to build the server
* Run `python build_client.py` to build the client
